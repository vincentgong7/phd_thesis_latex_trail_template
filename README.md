## Quick info
I re-organized the folder structure for the latest update (2nd version). It is more clear and easy to use. It is strong recommended to finish reading all the following points before diving into the LaTeX files. It only takes you 5 minutes.

- **Main File:** `thesis.tex` in the root folder. The output is `thesis.pdf`.
- **Chapters:** Located in `ch-n-xxx` folders (e.g., `ch-1-introduction`), with images stored in `images` subfolders.
- **Supporting Chapters:** Found in `ch-x-others` (i.e. titel page, dedication, preface, bibliography, glossary, summary, author introduction and trail thesis series).
- **Appendices:** Stored in the `appendix` folder. Add multiple `.tex` files as needed.
- **User Configurations:** Add custom LaTeX packages in `config/defs_user.tex`.

Now, open `thesis.tex` and start editing your thesis!

## Optional Customizations

- **Add/Remove Base Packages:** Edit `config/defs_base.tex`.
- **Adjust Margins:** Modify `\geometry{left=1cm,right=1cm}` in `thesis.tex` (line 43).
- **Crop Lines:** Change color in `lib/trailthesis.cls` (line 167) from **"white"** to **"black"**. Only if you need.
- **Core Files:** Located in the `lib` folder. Modify only if necessary.


## History
- **2007‚Äì2009:** Original version by Rudy Negenborn.
- **2019:** Updated to meet TRAIL's new requirements; first GitHub release.
