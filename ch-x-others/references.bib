@article{Koppelman2005,
abstract = {Choice-based samples oversample infrequently chosen alternatives to obtain an effective representation of the behavior of people who select these alternatives. However, the use of choice-based samples requires recognition of the sampling process in formulating the estimation procedure. In general, this procedure can be accomplished by applying weights to the observed choices in the estimation process. Unfortunately, the use of such weighted estimation procedures for choice models does not yield efficient estimators. However, for the special case of the multinomial logit model with a full set of alternative-specific constants, the standard maximum likelihood estimator—which is efficient—can be used with adjustment of the alternative-specific constants. The same maximum likelihood estimator can also be used with adjustment to estimate nested logit models with choice-based samples. The proof of this property is qualitatively described, and examples demonstrate how to apply the adjustment procedure.},

@article{Koppelman2005,
abstract = {Choice-based samples oversample infrequently chosen alternatives to obtain an effective representation of the behavior of people who select these alternatives. However, the use of choice-based samples requires recognition of the sampling process in formulating the estimation procedure. In general, this procedure can be accomplished by applying weights to the observed choices in the estimation process. Unfortunately, the use of such weighted estimation procedures for choice models does not yield efficient estimators. However, for the special case of the multinomial logit model with a full set of alternative-specific constants, the standard maximum likelihood estimator—which is efficient—can be used with adjustment of the alternative-specific constants. The same maximum likelihood estimator can also be used with adjustment to estimate nested logit models with choice-based samples. The proof of this property is qualitatively described, and examples demonstrate how to apply the adjustment procedure.},

abstract = "Large-scale events are becoming more frequent in contemporary cities, increasing the need for novel methods and tools that can provide relevant stakeholders with quantitative and qualitative insights about attendees’ characteristics. In this work, we investigate how social media can be used to provide such insights. First, we screen a set of factors that characterize crowd behavior and introduce a set of proxies derived from social media data. We characterize the crowd in two city-scale events, Sail 2015 and King’s Day 2016, analyzing several properties of their attendees, including demographics, city-role, crowd temporal distribution, social media post locations, Point of Interest (PoI.) preferences, and word use. We show that it is possible to characterize crowds in city-scale events using social media data, thus paving the way for new real-time applications on crowd monitoring and management for city-scale events."
