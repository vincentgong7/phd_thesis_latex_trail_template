% Section: Main Chapters
%-------------------------------
% You can add more chapters here. To do so, copy and paste an existing 
% sample chapter's .tex file and its corresponding image folder. 
% This makes it easy to create and structure new chapters. 
%
% Naming Convention: 
% Each chapter should follow the format "ch-n-xxx/index", where:
% - "n" represents the chapter number,
% - "xxx" is a short descriptor for the chapter,
% - "index" is the main .tex file for the chapter. 
%
% While this naming convention is optional, it is highly recommended 
% to maintain consistency and organization for new chapters.

% chapter 1
\include{ch-1-intro/index}
\clearemptydoublepage 

% chapter 2
\include{ch-2-charateristics/index}
