% define the base directory in which your thesis files are located
%
%
% NOTE WINDOWS USERS: the '\' in the Windows directory name should

%
% NOTE WINDOWS USERS: make sure that you thesis files are in
%                     a directory *without* spaces in the name,
%                     so: C:/thesis, and not C:/My Document/My Thesis
%
% NOTE: make sure that the directory name ends with a '/'
