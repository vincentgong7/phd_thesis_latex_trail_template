City-scale events are getting more popular and attract a large number of people participating in various activities. For instance, on Kingâ€™s Day, a national holiday in the Netherlands, a huge amount of people pour into the city and gather in the urban area, participating in various activities such as street parties, music festivals and boat parades. Event stakeholders, such as event organisers, police, municipalities, and crowd managers manage the crowd to avoid incidents. Crowd management practice consists of two phases \citep{martella2017current}, i.e. the planning phase and operational phase. In the planning phase, crowd managers require the past event data to infer guidelines, and to perform computer simulations of the crowds in the event.
